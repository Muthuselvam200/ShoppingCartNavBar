# ShoppingCartNavBar

- I've build a simple shopping cart navigation bar while learning about ReactJs...
- I've referred "Programming with Mosh" channel for this project...
- Well, it's good to start Reactjs with this kind of cool project...
- Since I can't able to upload all the npm modules along with this, so you should install them seperately when you clone'em...
